# [fnf-song-converter](https://cabalex.github.io/fnf-song-converter/)

A song converter for [my Scratch FNF clone](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/519325355/). The converter converts song JSON files made in the [Friday Night Funkin'](https://ninja-muffin24.itch.io/funkin) song editor (go into a song and press 7) to TXT files that can be imported into Scratch lists (right click on the list > import...).

Coded with [pretty bad] HTML and JS.
